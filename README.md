📦 Project Title

Multi-Source Sales Data Pipeline & Business Insights Dashboard

🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to design and implement a scalable data pipeline that consolidates sales data from multiple sources — including CSV, Excel, and JSON — into a unified dataset for business analytics.

The pipeline focuses on:

Data Cleaning – Handle missing values, ensure type consistency, and fix formatting.

Data Integration – Merge and unify data from multiple file formats.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Identify sales trends, patterns, and key metrics.

Visualization & Reporting – Present insights through charts and exportable reports.

This project highlights core data engineering and data analytics skills crucial for enterprise-level decision making.
