Project Title:

Customer Segmentation & Product Recommendation System

Objective:

The aim of the project is to analyse the customers product history to segment buyers and suggests to suitable products to buyers using segments.

The project targets on:

-->Data Cleaning - handling missing values and organises the data.

-->Featured Engineering - Derive metrics such as total spend, purchase frequency, and preferred categories.

-->Customer Segmentation – Apply clustering techniques to group customers.

-->Recommendation System – Build collaborative or content-based filtering logic.

-->Profile Analysis – Describe each customer segment in terms of behavior and spending.

-->Visualizations – Charts showing segment sizes, spending patterns, and top recommendations.

Tools :

Python-pandas,numpy,matplotlib,seaborn,scikit-learn.

Environment: Jupyter Notebook & VS Code

Version Control: Git & GitHub

--> Data cleaning:

Handled missing values by filling or removing invalid records.

Standardized column names and product categories for consistency.

Created derived features such as Month, Revenue, and Sales Count for analysis.

-->Featured Engineering:

  Creating new columns such as Sum = sum of purchases , Count = product count , Mean = average of purchases.
  
-->Customer Segmentation:
   
   Using the featured columns and apply clustering techniques like KMean

-->Recommendation System:
   
   Summarizes the behavior.
   
   Perferes the segment for purchase amounts.
   
   And rankings to purchase amounts.

-->Profile Analysis:
   
   Summarize the behavior.
   
   Spending habits and preferences of each group.
   
   And average total spent and avg preferred frequency.

-->Visualizations:
   
   Visualizing using matplotlib and seaborn.
   
   Present insights clearly and visually.
   
   Using barchart:preferred category per segment
       
   boxplot:total spent and purchase perquency as per segment
        
   countplot:customer count
Conclusion:

This project successfully demonstrates how groups customers based on their purchase behavior and gives suitable 

product recommendations.

It helps businesses understand customers better and improve their sales through personalized suggestions
