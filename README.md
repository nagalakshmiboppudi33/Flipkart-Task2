Project Title:

Multi-Source Sales Data Pipeline & Business Insights Dashboard

Objective:

The goal of this project is to design and implement a scalable data pipeline that consolidates sales data from multiple sources — including CSV, Excel, and JSON — into a unified dataset for business analytics.

The pipeline focuses on:

Data Cleaning – Handle missing values, ensure type consistency, and fix formatting.

Data Integration – Merge and unify data from multiple file formats.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Identify sales trends, patterns, and key metrics.

Visualization & Reporting – Present insights through charts and exportable reports.

This project highlights core data engineering and data analytics skills crucial for enterprise-level decision making.

Tools & Technologies:

Programming: Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
Reporting (Optional): pdfkit, tabulate
Environment: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
Version Control: Git & GitHub

Data Preparation:

Converted date columns into datetime format.

Standardized column names and product categories for consistency.

Handled missing values by filling or removing invalid records.

Created derived features such as Month, Revenue, and Sales Count for analysis.

Data Integration:

Combined data from CSV, Excel, and JSON into a single master dataset.

Applied schema unification to align data formats across sources.

Generated a clean and structured dataset ready for further analysis and dashboarding.

Analysis & Insights:

Key Findings (Demo Data):

Total Revenue Generated: ₹255

Top Product: Widget A contributed the highest revenue in January 2025.

Trend Analysis: Monthly revenue trend shows gradual growth, ideal for sales forecasting.

Business Implications: Insights help in inventory planning, regional targeting, and marketing optimization.

Visualizations:

All visual outputs are saved under outputs/visuals/.

Bar Chart: Revenue by Product

Line Plot: Monthly Revenue Trend

(Optional) Pie Chart / Heatmap: Product share or regional analysis

Reports:

Generated outputs and summaries:

File Name	Description
product_revenue.csv	Revenue by product
monthly_revenue.csv	Monthly revenue summary
summary_report.pdf	Business insights report (optional)

Execution Guide:

Install dependencies using the command:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Open and run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script.
Generated results and reports will appear in the outputs/ folder.

Conclusion:

This project successfully demonstrates how raw multi-source sales data can be transformed into clean, unified, and insight-rich datasets through a structured data pipeline.
It lays the groundwork for advanced business intelligence dashboards and automated reporting systems in enterprise environments.
